**Who I am.**

I am Researcher (category Independent) at [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar) and an Associate Professor (tenured) at [FAMAF](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar), University of Córdoba (Argentina). Also, I am the Team Leader (Argentinean side) of the [Theory of Structured Data](https://sites.google.com/view/theoryofstructureddata-sinfin/home/) of the French-Argentinean [LIA SINFIN](http://www.irp-sinfin.org).

I held the Jean d'Alembert Research Chair at the [Laboratoire Méthodes Formelles (LMF)](https://lmf.cnrs.fr/) from [Université Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) (France), during my sabbatical in 2025.

Also, I have been a Visiting Associate Professor at [Guangdong Technion Institute - GTIIT](https://www.gtiit.edu.cn/en/) (China) in Spring 2025, and a Visiting Assistant Professor in 2022-2023.

Before that, I finished my Phd thesis in 2014 under supervision of [Carlos Areces](https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~careces) at FAMAF, University of Córdoba, Argentina. The title of my thesis is **Relation-Changing Modal Logics**.

Even before, I received my Master and Bachelor degrees at the [CS Department](https://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/), University of Río Cuarto, Argentina.

My interests in research include:

* Modal Logics. Model theory. Proof theory. Computational aspects.

* Dynamic Logics. Epistemic Logics. Separation Logics.

* Knowledge representation. Non-monotonic reasoning.

* Automated deduction. Interactive theorem proving.

**Current services:**

* Head of the CS Doctoral Program at [FAMAF](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar), University of Córdoba (Argentina).

* Coordinator (Alternate) of the Informatics and Communications Commission for promotions, admissions and annual reports at [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar), Argentina.

* Team Leader (Arg. side) of the group [Theory of Structured Data](https://sites.google.com/view/theoryofstructureddata-sinfin/) in the [LIA SINFIN](http://www.irp-sinfin.org).

* Member of the Logics, Interaction and Intelligent Systems [(LIIS) group](http://liis.famaf.unc.edu.ar/), at FAMAF-UNC (Argentina).
