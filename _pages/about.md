I am a Tenured Professor (Adjunto) in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.mat.exa.unrc.edu.ar) at the [University of Río Cuarto](https://www.unrc.edu.ar/), and a Researcher (Asistente) at [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/).

I finished my Phd thesis in 2015 under the supervision of Tom Maibaum at [McMaster University](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/cas), Canada. The title of my thesis was _A Logical Basis for Reasoning with Default Rules_.

From 2015 to 2017 I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the McMaster Centre for Software Certification ([McSCERT](https://www.mcscert.ca/)), Canada. I returned to Argentina in 2017 thanks to a CONICET Postdoctoral Scholarship to work in the Logics, Interaction and Intelligent Systems ([LIIS](https://liisgroup.github.io/)) group under the supervision of Carlos Areces.

My research interests include:

_Non-monotonic Reasoning. Default Logics. Deontic Logics. Algebraic Logic. Dynamic Logics. Epistemic Logics. Logics with Data. Tableaux Systems._
