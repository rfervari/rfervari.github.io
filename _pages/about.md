**Who I am.**

I am Adjoint Researcher (permanent) at [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar) and a Professor (tenured) at [FAMAF](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar), University of Córdoba (Argentina).

I finished my Phd thesis in 2014 under supervision of [Carlos Areces](https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~careces) at FAMAF, University of Córdoba, Argentina. The title of my thesis is **Relation-Changing Modal Logics**.

Before that, I received my Master and Bachelor degrees at University of Río Cuarto, Argentina.

My interests in research include:

* Modal Logics. Model theory. Proof theory. Computational aspects.

* Dynamic Logics. Epistemic Logics. Separation Logics.

* Knowledge representation. Non-monotonic reasoning.

* Automated deduction. Interactive theorem proving.

**More:**

* Member of the Logics, Interaction and Intelligent Systems [(LIIS) group](https://liis.famaf.unc.edu.ar), at FAMAF-UNC (Argentina).

* Member of the group [Theory of Structured Data](https://sites.google.com/view/theoryofstructureddata-sinfin/) in the [LIA SINFIN](http://www.lia-sinfin.org/).
